    "# Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in this lesson: numeric and character types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats.\n",
    "A **floating point** (known as a float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is `0`.\n",
    "For example: `1.13`, `2.0`, `1234.345`.\n",
    "If we have a column that contains both integers and floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "In a vector or data fram (we learn about these different types later) the entire object or an entire column will be of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer** will never have a decimal point.\n",
    "Thus `1.13` would be stored as `1`, and `1234.345` is stored as `1234`.\n",
    "You will often see the data type `Int64` in python which stands for 64 bit integer.\n",
    "The 64 simply refers to the amount of memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can store in each \"cell\".\n",
    "Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Character Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are values that contain numbers and/or characters. \n",
    "For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. \n",
    "A string can also contain or consist of numbers.\n",
    "For instance, `'1234'` could be stored as a string, as could `'10.23'`.\n",
    "However, **strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations**!"

    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the [Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas).\n",
    "The Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy **Pandas cheatsheet** can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax `LibraryName.FunctionName`.\n",
    "Adding the library name with a `.` before the function name tells Python where to find the function.\n",
    "In the example above, we have imported Pandas as `pd`.\n",
    "This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each time we call a Pandas function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## So What's a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional (labeled) data structure that stores data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more) in columns.\n",

    "It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in R. \n",

    "According to [Hadley Wickham](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html):\n",
