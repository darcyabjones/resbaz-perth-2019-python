    "# 4. Data Types and Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of individual columns and rows will impact analysis performed on a dataset read into python.\n",
    "For example, you can’t perform mathematical calculations on a string (text formatted data).\n",
    "This might seem obvious, however sometimes numeric values are read into Python as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of data that we’re explore in this lesson: numeric and text data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats.\n",
    "A floating point (known as a float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0.\n",
    "For example: `1.13`, `2.0`, `1234.345`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer will never have a decimal point.\n",
    "Thus if we wanted to store 1.13 as an integer it would be stored as 1.\n",
    "You will often see the data type `int64` when using Pandas which stands for \"64 bit integer\".\n",
    "The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can store.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a column that contains both integers and floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Data Type (Strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can contain numbers and/or characters.\n",
    "For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences.\n",
    "A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, ‘1234’ could be stored as a string, as could ‘10.23’. \n",
    "However strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas and base Python use slightly different names for data types. More on this is in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pandas Type | Native Python Type | Description |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| object | string | The most general dtype. Will be assigned to your column if column has mixed types (numbers and strings). |\n",
    "| int64  | int | Numeric characters. 64 refers to the memory allocated to hold this character. |\n",
    "| float64 | float | Numeric characters with decimals. If a column contains numbers and NaNs(see below), pandas will default to float64, in case your missing value has a decimal. |\n",
    "| datetime64, timedelta[ns] | N/A (but see the [datetime] module in Python's standard library) | Values meant to hold time data. Look into these for time series experiments. |\n",
    "\n",
    "[datetime]: http://doc.python.org/3/library/datetime.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking the format of our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’re armed with a basic understanding of numeric and text data types, let’s explore the format of our survey data.\n",
