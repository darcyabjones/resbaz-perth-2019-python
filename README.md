# resbaz-perth-2019-python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for the 2019 Perth Research Bazaar, Python stream.

The lesson is adapted from the [Data Carpentry Ecology lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) and the [CIC software captentry material](https://github.com/CurtinIC/cic-swc-material).


## Setup

Please try to install a bash terminal, Python 3, and the required packages before coming.
If you're unable to get it running, don't stress!
We'll have people to help you on the day.

Instructions for installing a bash terminal are available at the [software carpentry shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).
Instructions for installing Python 3 using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) are available at the [software carpentry python lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/).

The full anaconda installation already installs all of the packages we will use.
If you install the "miniconda" version, you'll also need to install the python packages separately.

Open up Git Bash or your terminal and enter:

```bash
conda install -y numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```


## Get started

You can start running the Jupyter notebook by opening Git Bash or your terminal and entering:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You should then see some text printed to screen, and a tab should open up in your web-browser.
